One of the biggest changes is the buff to the durability toolkit of the spec, allowing you to have less \"kiting\" tanking than before. The spec still possesses one of the best mob controls across any tanking spec in Mythic+, which will turn valuable for any team looking for a tank. One of their biggest advantages is having one of the highest damage profiles across all tank specs (even after the bug fixes), extremely high self-sustain and great mob-control, which are the mains reason why we believe their current performance warrants S-tier.",

Luckily, the compensation buffs that came, (% flat damage adjustments, stronger [无视苦痛], and better self-sustain thanks to more Rage) which makes up for all the other nerfs. In addition, a new recent build has been discovered, making their single-target and AoE damage the best among any other tank DPS, which immensely improves their performance. Although you can have durability troubles at time (especially against continuous magical damage) your damage profile offsets the negatives, making them one of the best choices starting in Season 2.",

In addition, they have incredible mob control which is another reason why the spec is so highly desired. Overall, they are currently ranked as one of the better tank entering Season 2.",

They are getting a new tier set supported by a hefty amount of RNG and arguably worse than what the Season 1 set had to offer. In addition, defensively and offensively are at a disadvantage compared to the top-ranked tanks, further pushing them down the list. Overall, it is still early to have a final estimate of how the spec will rank. Still, preliminary thoughts are that the spec performance is much better on the lower level keys (the main factory is the highest self-sustain) compared to the higher level ones, where you might struggle when tanking several packs together.",

Their performance is currently better than what it was in Season 1 as the durability aspect of the spec has been improved. But, usual issues yet remain to be solved: not enough self-sustain, which often relies on much more \"babysitting\" from your healer. On top of this, they are one of the most difficult tanks to master, further pushing the barrier of entry higher and higher (especially with that many buttons in your rotation). We expect further tuning to hit PTR and hopefully, we can revisit the rankings.",
